## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is the source code for my personal website at https://maitreyakv.com, which is written in Rust!

## Features

The website is a single page application written in the [Sycamore](https://sycamore.dev/) framework in Rust! It uses Tailwind CSS for styling, and is compiled and packaged using [Trunk](https://trunkrs.dev/). 

## Development

To build and test the site locally, you can do the following:

1. Install [Rust & Cargo](https://rustup.rs/)
2. Install [Trunk](https://trunkrs.dev/#install)
3. Run `make serve` and navigate to `localhost:8080`
